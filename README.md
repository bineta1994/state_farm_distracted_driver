# Project Title: State Farm Distracted Driver Claims Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the State Farm Claims dataset to improve the claims process and detect potentially fraudulent claims related to distracted driving behavior. The goal is to develop models that accurately predict the severity of claims and identify instances of distracted driving using both tabular data and image analysis techniques. By leveraging data science and machine learning, we aim to enhance the efficiency of the claims assessment process, minimize financial losses due to fraudulent claims, and contribute to a safer driving environment.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:

- **Data Collection**: The State Farm Claims dataset, which includes both tabular data and images of drivers, is used for analysis. The dataset was collected by State Farm and provides valuable insights into claim severity and distracted driving behavior.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables. Feature engineering techniques are applied to extract relevant information from the images.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is conducted to gain insights into the data, identify correlations, and understand the distribution of variables. This helps in identifying patterns and trends related to claim severity and distracted driving.

- **Model Development**: Various machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, are trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics. The models are aimed at accurately predicting claim severity and detecting instances of distracted driving.

- **Performance Evaluation**: The models' performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This allows us to measure the effectiveness of the models in classifying claims and identifying distracted driving behavior.

- **Insights and Recommendations**: The project provides insights into the factors contributing to claim severity and the effectiveness of the models in detecting distracted driving. Recommendations are made to improve the claim assessment process, minimize fraudulent claims, and promote safer driving practices.

## Project Outcome
The project highlights the challenges and opportunities in analyzing distracted driving claims. While the initial models show room for improvement, the project lays the foundation for future research and development in this domain. By enhancing the models' performance and incorporating advanced image analysis techniques, it is possible to achieve more accurate predictions and contribute to a safer driving environment. The findings and recommendations from this project can assist insurance companies, such as State Farm, in improving their claims assessment process and reducing fraudulent claims.
